Who am I
========
I'm {% years_from 1987, 11, 23 %} years old, I'm Portuguese, and I live in Lisbon since I went to the faculty.
I like programming, intelectual challenges, and above all, learning new things and technologies.

On my free time, whenever I'm not programming, I'm most likely hanging out with friends,
playing video and board games, listening to music, or watching movies or TV series (Game of Thrones ftw).
When I have the time and money, I also like to travel, either in Portugal or to other countries.

Current Situation
=================

I've been working at SAPO (PT Comunica&ccedil;&otilde;es) since 2011,
where I'm responsible for most of the programming on our security team.
My job includes maintaining our vulnerability management backoffice,
developing a security library for developers in various languages, and
sometimes I even perform some security audits myself.
Recently I've left the security team to join [**MEO Cloud's**](https://meocloud.pt/)
team, where I'll be working on the server side with technologies such as Django,
Cassandra, Solr, etc.

Education
==========

I have a graduation in Computer Engineering by FCUL (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon)
and a [Master in Information Security](http://cmuportugal.di.fc.ul.pt/?MSc_in_Information_Security) by both FCUL and CMU (Carnegie Mellon University).

Technical Knowledge
===================

While I was at the faculty I programmed in **Java** in my projects whenever I could as it was the first language I had learned.
As an hobby, I also participated in many programming contests where I gained a good level of knowledge on **Algorithms and Data Structures**.
After the faculty I have [completed]({{ media_url('pdf/algo_coursera_cert.pdf')}}) a [course on Algorithms](https://class.coursera.org/algo/wiki/view?page=Syllabus) from Coursera on the topic in order to refresh my knowledge.

These days, my favorite programming language is by far **Python**.
I use it mainly for scripting and for developing web applications,
where I use [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as my choice framework.
I know **SQL**, and typically use **MySQL** for my databases, although I've been meaning to try PostgreSQL for some time.

I also know how to use **HTML**, **CSS**, **LESS**, **Javascript**, **JQuery**, [**Ink**](http://ink.sapo.pt/), etc.,
meaning I can work both on the backend and frontends of websites.

I do all my work in a Ubuntu based distro, meaning I'm well versed in the command line and on working with **Linux**.
As for my VCS, the first I've tried was **Git** and I haven't looked back since.

Last but not least, I've also got good knowledge of information security,
the result of a Master and more than two years working in a security team.
My work at SAPO is focused on **Web Security** making it my strong suit,
but I've also [completed]({{ media_url('pdf/crypto_coursera_cert.pdf')}}) a [course on **Cryptography**](https://class.coursera.org/crypto/wiki/view?page=Overview)
from Coursera which gave me more than enough knowledge of crypto.
